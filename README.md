# encrypted-nostr-msgs

*A mobile-first web app for sending e2e encrypted messages between disposable Nostr accounts.*

This app was inspired by [SendStr](https://github.com/vilm3r/sendstr-web) and seeks to replicate its UI and functionality. Rather than fork that repository, this codebase started as a fork of [react-bootstrap-web-spa](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/react-bootstrap-web3-spa), and much of the functional code was ported from SendStr.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/encrypted-nostr-msgs
cd encrypted-nostr-msgs
npm install
npm start
npm run build
```
